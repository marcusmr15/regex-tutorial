# Regex Tutorial

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn how to use Regular Expressions `Regex` for pattern matching, text manipulation, and data validation. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of Regex, explaining its components and syntax with a practical application. In this case, we will be analyzing a Regex that matches URLs of any kind, length, and pathing.

Here is what the Regex with these characteristics looks like:

~~~
\bhttps?:\/\/[\w.-]+([\/?@#$%^&*()!~`=+[\]{}|;:'",<>\w.-]+)?
~~~
